var maxDepth = function(root){
    if(!root) return 0;

    let leftSubHeight = maxDepth(root.left);
    let rightSubHeight = maxDepth(root.right);

    return Math.max(leftSubHeight ,rightSubHeight) + 1;
}





/* Let's break down this maxDepth function line by line to understand what it's doing:

javascript
Copy code
var maxDepth = function (root) {
Function Declaration: This is a function expression that assigns an anonymous function to the variable maxDepth. The function takes one parameter, root, which represents the root node of the tree (or subtree) for which we want to calculate the maximum depth. If the tree is empty, root will be null.
javascript
Copy code
    if (!root) return 0;
Base Case (Termination Condition): Here, we check if the root is falsy (null or undefined in JavaScript). This is the base case of the recursion. If the current node is null, it means we've reached beyond the leaf node (no children), so the depth at this point is zero. We return 0 because there's no depth to measure when there's no node.
javascript
Copy code
    let leftSubHeight = maxDepth(root.left);
Recursive Call (Left Subtree): This line recursively calls the maxDepth function on the left child of the current root. The result is stored in the leftSubHeight variable. This function keeps traversing down the left subtree of the tree to calculate the maximum depth of the left subtree.
javascript
Copy code
    let rightSubHeight = maxDepth(root.right);
Recursive Call (Right Subtree): Similarly, this line recursively calls the maxDepth function on the right child of the current root. The result is stored in the rightSubHeight variable. It calculates the maximum depth of the right subtree by going down the right side of the tree.
javascript
Copy code
    return Math.max(leftSubHeight, rightSubHeight) + 1;
Combine and Return: Once the recursive calls for both left and right subtrees are completed, the function uses Math.max() to find the greater depth between the left and right subtrees. It adds 1 to the result to account for the current root node. This ensures that the height of the tree is calculated as the maximum height of its subtrees plus one for the current node.
Explanation with Example
Consider a tree like this:

markdown
Copy code
      1
     / \
    2   3
   / \
  4   5
Here's what happens in the function:

Starting at root (node 1), it calls maxDepth on the left subtree (root.left = node 2).
At node 2, it calls maxDepth on its left subtree (node 4) and right subtree (node 5).
Since node 4 and node 5 are leaf nodes (no children), both their left and right recursive calls return 0, so their heights are 1 (Math.max(0, 0) + 1).
At node 2, the height of the left subtree (node 4) is 1, and the height of the right subtree (node 5) is also 1, so the height of node 2 is 2 (Math.max(1, 1) + 1).
A similar process happens for the right subtree (node 3), which has no children, so its height is 1.
Finally, at the root (node 1), the left subtree height is 2 and the right subtree height is 1. The total height of the tree is 3 (Math.max(2, 1) + 1).
This function runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of nodes, since it visits every node exactly once. The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.

A real-life analogy to help you remember the maxDepth function and its purpose can be tied to exploring a mountain. Here's a story you can share during an interview that not only makes the concept easier to remember but also gives a concrete example:

Scenario:
Imagine you're an adventurous explorer climbing a vast mountain range, and your goal is to find the highest peak. You start at the base of the mountain (the root node of the tree) and have two main trails to explore:

Left trail: leading to one part of the mountain (left subtree).
Right trail: leading to another part of the mountain (right subtree).
Steps:
At each point (or node), you stand at a junction where you need to decide which side (left or right) to explore first. You decide to go all the way down the left trail until you can't go any further (reaching the base case when root is null).
Once you reach the end of the left trail, you measure how far you've come (the depth). Then, you return to the junction and explore the right trail in the same way.
At each junction, after you explore both the left and right trails, you compare which one took you higher (calculated using Math.max) and add 1 to account for the point where you're standing (current node).
Ultimately, when you've explored all possible paths from the start, youâ€™ll have determined the height of the tallest peak (the maximum depth of the tree).
Use Case:
This analogy can be likened to organizational hierarchy or project management. For instance, if you're managing a company with a branching leadership structure (a tree), and you want to find out the maximum number of reporting levels between the CEO and the most junior employees, you'd use a similar approach. You'd start from the CEO (root) and work your way down through each department (subtree), comparing levels until you reach the deepest layer of employees (leaf nodes).

In the same way, the maxDepth function helps you find the deepest "chain of command" (height) in any hierarchical structure.

Key points for the interviewer:
Recursive exploration: Like exploring each path in a mountain range.
Base case (null): Representing when you've reached the end of a path.
Comparing heights: Just like comparing which trail leads to the highest peak, the function compares the depth of left and right subtrees.
Adding 1: Representing your current position in the hierarchy (or junction in the mountain).
This analogy makes the recursive nature and the purpose of the maxDepth function easy to remember and explain. */
